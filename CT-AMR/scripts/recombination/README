#####Recombination  analysis was performed using ClomalFrameML with default parameters 
##run clonalframe with the following command
ClonalFrameML ../core_alignment.fasta.varsites.phy.treefile cleaned.fasta CF__alignment

##### To identify regions of high recombination events, sequence alignemnt was divided into 1000bp transcripts and 
##### frequency of recombination events were recorded per transcripts.
##### Transctips with high activity were classified as recombination hotspots
######Now run this file to get recomb hotspots! 
python cluster_importation_events.py
